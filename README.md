# n8n_template

Hi n8n users

As a data scientist who recently discovered n8n's potential for building automated data pipelines, I created this focused cheat sheet covering the essential nodes specifically for data analysis workflows.
Coming from traditional data science tools, I found n8n incredibly powerful for automating repetitive data tasks - from scheduled data collection to preprocessing and result distribution. This cheat sheet focuses on the core nodes I use most frequently for:
Automated data ingestion from APIs, databases, and files
Data transformation and cleaning operations
Basic analysis and aggregation
Exporting results to various destinations
Perfect for fellow data scientists looking to streamline their workflows with no-code automation!
Hope this helps others bridge the gap between traditional data science and workflow automation. ðŸš€
